If you think all great cameras cost a pretty penny, Nikon's Coolpix B500 is here to prove you wrong. Despite being priced well under $400, this thing is packed with goodness. The bridge camera sports a 16MP (1/2.3-inch) image sensor, but what truly makes it stand out is the integrated 4.0-160mm Nikkor zoom lens. With a massive optical zoom range of 40x, it lets you shoot incredible close-up pictures of even the furthest of subjects (e.g. birds, The Moon) with little to no effort. Throughout the entire zoom range, the camera's optical lens-based VR (Vibration Reduction) technology helps in stabilizing shots, giving you clear photos. The Coolpix B500 comes with numerous shooting modes (e.g. Auto, Scene, and Creative), each having a variety of presets that are programmed to help you get the best photos. Thanks to a 3-inch tilting LCD monitor (with 921k-dot resolution), you can frame shots even from tricky angles with ease. For connectivity and I/O, there's Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth, micro HDMI, and USB included in the mix. Among other noteworthy features are a standard ISO range of 125-1600 (6400 in Auto Mode), contrast-detect AF system, and Full-HD video recording at up to 60fps.
