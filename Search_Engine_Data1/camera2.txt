Offering great all-round performance and a host of features, Canon's EOS Rebel T6 is undeniably one of the best cameras available under $400 today. Also known as the EOS 1300D outside of North America, it comes with an 18MP APS-C sensor that works alongside Canon's "DIGIC 4+" image processor, resulting in sharp and detailed photos. And with a standard ISO range of 100-6400 (expandable to 12800), you can capture amazing photos even in low light conditions. An entry-level DSLR (Digital Single-Lens Reflex) camera, the EOS Rebel T6 includes an EF-S 18-55mm IS II zoom lens that's perfect for everyday photography. However, it's also fully compatible with a huge variety (e.g. macro, wide-angle) of Canon's EF/EF-S lenses. The camera's 9-point AF system allows you to track and shoot even fast-moving subjects easily, while its high-performance optical viewfinder makes composing shots a cakewalk. You also get multiple shooting modes (e.g. Scene Intelligent Auto, Landscape, Night Portrait, Program AE, and Manual Exposure), a 3-inch LCD monitor (with 920k-dot resolution), as well as integrated Wi-Fi and NFC to directly share images with other devices and social media services. Canon EOS Rebel T6 supports continuous shooting at up to 3fps and can record Full-HD videos at up to 30fps too.
