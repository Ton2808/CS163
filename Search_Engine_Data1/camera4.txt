Let me preface this review with one caveat – you may struggle to get hold of this excellent entry-level Nikon DSLR. At the time of writing, only a few ‘refurbished’ models are available, with the stock quickly dwindling.

The popularity of the Nikon D3400 with 18-55mm lens has mainly been due to its price – for less than $500, you’re getting a helluva-lot of camera for your money!
